>DKOs are streaming where-ever possible.  Assuming your JDBC driver isn't terribly written you can iterate over huge datasets that would be impossible to fit into memory.  (And we do - few companies have larger data sets than my employer)</P
><P
>Comparisons to Hibernate are tricky.  When optimized, Hibernate is every bit as fast as DKOs.  (both are barely distinguishable from pure JDBC)  But when you factor in the time it takes to optimize Hibernate queries vs. DKO queries (and the fact that developer hours are limited), anecdotal evidence (a known mixed environment of Hibernate and DKOs) suggests that DKOs average runtimes less than half of comparable Hibernate queries.  (and with substantially less code)</P

></H2

>When you get a DKO object back from the database it is by default automatically linked to a object called a UsageMonitor.  This monitor is generated once per query and all objects report back to it when fields are accessed.  It then persists this information to use during later runs of your program.</P
><P
>If your code does not use a field and you have not explicitly stated which fields the query is to select, the next time it is run that column will not be selected.  If your code does try to read a column that was previously optimized out of a query, the value of the column will be lazy-loaded, and the next time your query is run the field will be selected again.</P
